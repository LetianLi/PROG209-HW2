**Assignment:**


Code the HTML to use a Form. The form should have:
- a set of 3 radio buttons where the user can specify a pizza size of small, medium, or large.
- a dropdown feature (a select) where they can specify if they want no toppings, one topping, or 2 toppings.

There should be a form submit button. When the user clicks the submit, your JS code should calculate the price and show it to the user.

Use this pricing:
- Small $7.00
- Medium $10.00
- Large $14.00
- 1 topping $2.00
- 2 toppings $3.00
